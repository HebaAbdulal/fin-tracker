### Solved bug
I encountered an issue during deployment due to the failure of pip3 freeze > requirements.txt to generate the required libraries automatically. Consequently, I manually searched for the missing libraries and their versions to resolve the issue.
<br>

## Deployment
- The program was deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
- You can access the deployed application [here](https://fintracker-d91e74e9f79d.herokuapp.com/).

Deployment Steps:

1. In the workspace (such as GitPod), run the command pip3 freeze > requirements.txt in the terminal. This command generates a list of requirements needed for the project to run and saves it in the requirements.txt file.
2. Create a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account if you haven't already.
3. After creating a Heroku account, navigate to the Dashboard and click on "Create New App" (you may need to click the "New" tab first and then select "Create New App" from the dropdown menu).
4. Choose a unique name for your app and select the appropriate region.
5. Once the app is created, go to the "Settings" section from the navigation bar.
6. Scroll down to the "Config Vars" section and click on "Reveal Config Vars". 
7. Add a new Config Var with "KEY" as "CREDS". Open the "creds.json" file from your workspace, copy its contents, and paste them into the "VALUE" field. Click "Add".
8. Add another Config Var with "KEY" as "PORT" and "VALUE" as "8000".
9. Scroll down to the "Buildpacks" section and click on "Add Buildpack".
10. Add the Python buildpack first, then add the Node.js buildpack.
11. Make sure the buildpacks are in the correct order (Python first, then Node.js). You can drag and drop them if needed.
12. Scroll back to the top navigation bar and click on "Deploy".
13. Next to "Deployment method", select "GitHub". Connect to your GitHub repository by typing its name, searching for it, and connecting to it.
14. Enable automatic deploys and then manually deploy the branch.
15. Wait for the app to be deployed.

## Future improvements
- User Authentication: Implement user authentication to allow multiple users to track their income and expenses securely. This could include features like user registration, login, and password recovery.
- Mobile Compatibility: Optimize the application for mobile devices to allow users to track their finances on the go. This could involve creating a responsive design or developing dedicated mobile apps for iOS and Android platforms.
